We have investigated the dynamics of particles in the vicinity of a static spherically symmetric black hole in f(R) gravity. Using the Euler-Lagrange method the dynamical equations of a neutral particle are obtained. Assuming that the particle is initially moving in the innermost stable circular orbit, we have calculated its escape velocity, after a collision with some other particle. The conditions for the escape of colliding particles are discussed. The effective potential and the trajectories of the escaping particles are studied graphically.
